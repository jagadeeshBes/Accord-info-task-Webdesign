<p align="justify">Elizabeth Woolridge Grant was born on June 21, 1985,[11] in Manhattan, New York City,[12] to Robert England Grant Jr., a copywriter at Grey Group, and Patricia Ann "Pat" (née Hill), an account executive at the same organization.[13][14][15] She has a younger sister, Caroline "Chuck" Grant,[16] and a younger brother, Charlie Grant.[17][18] She was raised Roman Catholic and is of Scottish descent.[19][20] When she was one year old, the family moved to Lake Placid, New York.[21] In Lake Placid, her father worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor;[22] her mother worked as a schoolteacher.[23] There, she attended St. Agnes School in her elementary years[18] and began singing in her church choir,
 where she was the cantor.

Grant shared in an interview: "That's really why I got sent to boarding school aged 14—to get sober."[25] Her uncle, an admissions officer at the school, secured her financial aid to attend.[28] According to Grant, she had trouble making friends during much of her teenage and early adult years.[29][30] She has said she was preoccupied with death from a young age, and its role in her feelings of anxiety and alienation:</p>
