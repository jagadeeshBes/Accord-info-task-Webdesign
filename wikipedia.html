<summary>Early life</summary>
<p align="justify">Elizabeth Woolridge Grant was born on June 21, 1985,[11] in Manhattan, New York City,[12] to Robert England Grant Jr., a copywriter at Grey Group, and Patricia Ann "Pat" (née Hill), an account executive at the same organization.[13][14][15] She has a younger sister, Caroline "Chuck" Grant,[16] and a younger brother, Charlie Grant.[17][18] She was raised Roman Catholic and is of Scottish descent.[19][20] When she was one year old, the family moved to Lake Placid, New York.[21] In Lake Placid, her father worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor;[22] her mother worked as a schoolteacher.[23] There, she attended St. Agnes School in her elementary years[18] and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor.[18][24]

She attended the high school where her mother taught for one year,[23] but when she was 14[25] or 15,[26] her parents sent her to Kent School[27] to get sober from alcoholism. Grant shared in an interview: "That's really why I got sent to boarding school aged 14—to get sober."[25] Her uncle, an admissions officer at the school, secured her financial aid to attend.[28] According to Grant, she had trouble making friends during much of her teenage and early adult years.[29][30] She has said she was preoccupied with death from a young age, and its role in her feelings of anxiety and alienation:</p>

<summary>Career</summary>
<p align="justify">In fall 2004, at age 19, Grant enrolled at Fordham University in The Bronx where she majored in philosophy, with an emphasis on metaphysics.[12] She has said she chose to study the subject because it "bridged the gap between God and science... I was interested in God and how technology could bring us closer to finding out where we came from and why."[12] In spring 2005, while still in college, Del Rey registered a seven-track extended play with the United States Copyright Office; the application title was Rock Me Stable with another title, Young Like Me, also listed.[33] A second extended play, From the End, was also recorded under Del Rey's stage name at the time, May Jailer.[34] Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded an acoustic album, Sirens, under the May Jailer project,[34] which leaked on the internet in mid-2012.[3</p>
 <p align="justify">Del Rey graduated from Fordham with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 2008,[27] after which she released a three-track EP, Kill Kill, as Lizzy Grant, featuring production by Kahne.[38] She explained: "David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop."[39] Meanwhile, Del Rey was doing community outreach work for homeless individuals and drug addicts;[12] she had become interested in community service work in college, when she "took a road trip across the country to paint and rebuild houses on a Native American reservation".[18][40]

Of choosing a stage name for her feature debut album, she said: "I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba—Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue."[41] The name was also inspired by actress Lana Turner and the Ford Del Rey sedan, produced and sold in Brazil in the 1980s.[42] Initially she used the alternate spelling Lana Del Ray, the name under which her self-titled debut album was released in January 2010.[37] Her father helped with the marketing of the album,[43] which was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn in April 2010.[37] Kahne and Nichtern both said that Del Rey bought the rights back from 5 Points, as she wanted it out of circulation to "stifle future opportunities to distribute it—an echo of rumors the action was part of a calculated strategy"</p>
