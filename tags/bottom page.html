CHAPTER35
San Diego Vindication
hortly after moving to Vegas, I realized promoters were the biggest cockblocks in the city.
Promoters would bring girls to their clients’ tables and introduce them while secretly
talking shit. The promoters didn’t want their clients to get laid, they just brought the girls to
drink the champagne. Clubs would pay promoters 10 percent of what their client spent, so the
goal was to run up their tab. Waitresses would get 18 percent via auto gratuity, so their goal
was the same, but their hustle was different. Waitresses were trained to flirt with the client,
upsell bottles, and ask for drinks. They’d then take full glasses of champagne to the bathroom,
dump them out, and repeat. The whole thing was a hustle designed to milk the sucker for all
they could.
This was 2011, before the rise of social media, sugar daddies, and Only Fans. Back when hot
girls went to nightclubs. I wanted to get laid, but I refused to take part in this scam, so I
figured out a way to circumvent the nonsense. The promoters were perpetually broke, and the
only thing they cared about more than pussy was money. So I established a deal with them
where I would pay $1,000 for every girl they introduced me to who I eventually fucked. But
they couldn’t be hookers, and the promoters couldn’t pay the women. I even offered a $5,000
bonus if I ended up seriously dating the girl. This changed the narrative. Now the promoter
had a vested interest in talking me up instead of doing the opposite.
A Vegas promoter lined up some girls, and I chartered a Hawker 800 to take us to San Diego
for a party. The party was at a mansion on Hillside Drive, one of the most expensive streets in
San Diego. We walked in through a two-foot-thick iron door that opened up to an infinity pool
and a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean. The pool deck was on the edge of a cliff that
boasted a 270-degree view of everything from the city to the valley to the coast.
The three-story mansion had curved walls of glass in every room. The master had a twostory closet with exotic wood and a bird’s-eye view of the ocean and coastline. But it was
virtually empty. It had barely any furniture and no decorations whatsoever.
The owner was a slightly out of shape country-club-looking guy named Charles. He wore
dock shoes, no socks, and a polo shirt. He was loaded but prided himself on being thrifty,
always working the angle, and getting a good deal. I was the opposite. I bragged about what I
spent and wanted people to think I paid more than I did.
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you what I pay to rent this place,” he said.
He teased me before finally revealing that rent was only six grand a month. I had been
looking at San Diego real estate and knew that was absurd. The place should have been
$80,000–$100,000 a month. I was completely confused. It didn’t make any sense, but I also
didn’t think he was lying, so I kept asking him for the story until he finally spilled the beans.
“The house was built on spec, and the builder declined an offer for $18 million. Then the
market crashed, and he rode it all the way down. Now he can’t legally sell it or rent it because
of some litigation with a neighbor over an encroaching support beam two hundred feet under
the ground. The whole thing is a mess. The house was just sitting empty until he found a
homeless man sleeping in the living room.
When my realtor told me what happened, I approached the owner directly. I offere<br>d to pay
cash and keep an eye on the place. The house is great, but I barely use it, I’m only<br> here a couple
days a month.”<br>
“Shit, would you w<br>ant to split that?” I asked.<br>
“Probably not worth itv for three grand.”
“What if I fully furnished the place, made it totally livable? It would be dialed in when you
came into town. We can split everything; I’ll <br>find a house<br> manager and get it all done.”
After some convincing, he agreed. I hired a proper<br>ty manager, vhousekeeping, decorator, and
a pool guy. Charles got a crazy deal on a used Ferrari<br> and stuck it in the garage. I had the
Cobra transported out and bought a seventies Land Cruiser.<br> The garage was full, but there
wasn’t one practical car on the whole property.</p>
